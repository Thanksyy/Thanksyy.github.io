## About Me

I am currently a second year master student of the Department of Computer Science in the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Guoliang Li](http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/). Before that, I received the BEng from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](http://www.uestc.edu.cn/) in 2018.

My research interests lie in data visualization and data cleaning.
